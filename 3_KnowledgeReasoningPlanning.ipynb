    "## **7.1 Knowledge-Based Agents**\n",
    "- **Overview**:\n",
    "  - Knowledge-based agents use a knowledge base (KB) to store and infer information about their environment.\n",
    "  - The agent processes percepts, queries the KB for appropriate actions, and updates it with new facts or actions taken.\n",
    "  - The KB is built using a **knowledge representation language** with defined syntax and semantics.\n",
    "- **TELL and ASK**:\n",
    "  - **TELL**: Adds information to the KB.\n",
    "  - **ASK**: Queries the KB to infer information.\n",
    "- **Declarative vs. Procedural Knowledge**:\n",
    "  - Declarative systems explicitly encode knowledge as facts and rules.\n",
    "  - Procedural systems encode knowledge as sequences of operations or algorithms.\n",
    "- **Design Approach**:\n",
    "  - Agents combine declarative (rules-based) and procedural (optimized operations) elements for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7.2 The Wumpus World**\n",
    "- **Environment Description**:\n",
    "  - A 4×4 grid-based cave containing pits, a gold piece, and the Wumpus (a dangerous creature).\n",
    "  - The agent perceives:\n",
    "    - **Stench** near the Wumpus.\n",
    "    - **Breeze** near pits.\n",
    "    - **Glitter** on the gold square.\n",
    "    - **Bump** upon hitting walls.\n",
    "    - **Scream** when the Wumpus is killed.\n",
    "- **Agent Objectives**:\n",
    "  - Safely retrieve the gold and exit the cave.\n",
    "  - Avoid pits and the Wumpus, making decisions based on logical reasoning.\n",
    "- **PEAS Description**:\n",
    "  - **Performance measure**: High reward for retrieving gold and exiting; penalties for being eaten or falling into pits.\n",
    "  - **Environment**: Grid-based, deterministic, and partially observable.\n",
    "  - **Actuators**: Move, grab, shoot, climb.\n",

    "### **7.3 Logic**\n",
    "- **Concepts**:\n",
    "  - **Syntax**: Defines how sentences are structured.\n",
    "  - **Semantics**: Defines the truth value of sentences in a possible world.\n",
    "  - **Models**: Mathematical representations of possible worlds, assigning truth values to sentences.\n",
    "- **Entailment**:\n",
    "  - A sentence $ \\alpha $ entails another $ \\beta $ if $ \\beta $ is true in all models where $ \\alpha $ is true.\n",
    "- **Inference**:\n",
    "  - Logical reasoning derives new sentences from existing ones using rules of inference.\n",
    "  - **Soundness**: Ensures only true conclusions are derived.\n",
    "  - **Completeness**: Ensures all true conclusions can be derived.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7.4 Propositional Logic**\n",
    "- **Syntax**:\n",
    "  - Atomic propositions (e.g., $ P, Q $).\n",
    "  - Logical connectives: $ \\neg $ (not), $ \\land $ (and), $ \\lor $ (or), $ \\implies $ (implies), $ \\iff $ (if and only if).\n",
    "- **Semantics**:\n",
    "  - Truth tables define the truth values of complex sentences based on atomic propositions.\n",
    "- **Knowledge Base Construction**:\n",
    "  - Rules represent the environment (e.g., breeze implies an adjacent pit).\n",
    "- **Inference via Model Checking**:\n",
    "  - Evaluates all possible models to determine entailment.\n",
    "  - Computationally expensive: $ O(2^n) $ for $ n $ propositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7.5 Propositional Theorem Proving**\n",
    "- **Theorem Proving vs. Model Checking**:\n",
    "  - Theorem proving applies rules of inference to derive conclusions directly from the KB without enumerating models.\n",
    "- **Logical Equivalence**:\n",
    "  - Two sentences are equivalent if true in the same set of models.\n",
    "- **Satisfiability**:\n",
    "  - A sentence is satisfiable if it is true in at least one model.\n",
    "  - **Resolution**: A sound and complete inference rule for propositional logic.\n",
    "  - Converts sentences into **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)** for efficient processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7.6 Building a Logical Agent**\n",
    "- **Combining Knowledge and Reasoning**:\n",
    "  - Logical agents use propositional logic to represent and reason about their environment.\n",
    "  - Example: A Wumpus World agent identifies safe paths, locates the Wumpus, and retrieves the gold by deducing facts using logical rules.\n",
    "- **Algorithm Design**:\n",
    "  - Construct and query the KB dynamically as new percepts are observed.\n",
    "  - Apply efficient inference techniques like resolution or heuristic-based theorem proving."

    "\n",
    "#### **8.1 Representation in First-Order Logic**\n",
    "- **Introduction**:\n",
    "  - First-Order Logic (FOL) is a more expressive system than propositional logic.\n",
    "  - FOL introduces objects, relations, and quantifiers to enable reasoning about more complex domains.\n",
    "- **Comparison with Propositional Logic**:\n",
    "  - Propositional logic represents facts but lacks expressiveness for relationships (e.g., \"King John has a crown\").\n",
    "  - FOL can define such relationships with predicates and quantifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8.2 Syntax and Semantics**\n",
    "- **Syntax**:\n",
    "  - Components:\n",
    "    - **Constants**: Refer to specific objects (e.g., \"John\").\n",
    "    - **Predicates**: Define relationships between objects (e.g., \"Loves(John, Mary)\").\n",
    "    - **Functions**: Map inputs to objects (e.g., \"Father(John)\" gives John's father).\n",
    "    - **Quantifiers**:\n",
    "      - **Universal (∀)**: Applies to all objects (e.g., \"Everyone loves their mother\").\n",
    "      - **Existential (∃)**: Applies to at least one object (e.g., \"Someone loves Mary\").\n",
    "  - Sentences are composed of terms, predicates, and logical connectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantics**:\n",
    "  - Defines truth values for FOL sentences in a given interpretation.\n",
    "  - A model includes objects, functions, and relations that give meaning to constants and predicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8.3 Inference in First-Order Logic**\n",
    "- **Logical Inference**:\n",
    "  - Inference derives new sentences from existing ones using rules such as **modus ponens**.\n",
    "  - Sound and complete inference methods ensure correctness and exhaustive reasoning.\n",
    "- **Forward and Backward Chaining**:\n",
    "  - **Forward Chaining**: Starts with known facts and applies rules to infer conclusions.\n",
    "  - **Backward Chaining**: Starts with a goal and works backward to find supporting evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8.4 Reduction to Propositional Logic**\n",
    "- **CNF Conversion**:\n",
    "  - FOL sentences are transformed into **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)** for efficient processing.\n",
    "  - Steps include skolemization (eliminating existential quantifiers) and flattening predicates.\n",
    "- **Applications**:\n",
    "  - Propositionalized FOL simplifies reasoning for automated systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8.5 Applications of FOL**\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - Representing knowledge in domains like medicine, engineering, and legal reasoning.\n",
    "  - Enabling robots to plan actions based on logical rules and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8.6 Summary**\n",
    "- **Key Points**:\n",
    "  - FOL enhances the expressiveness of logic with objects, predicates, and quantifiers.\n",
    "  - It enables modeling of complex relationships and reasoning in diverse domains.\n",
    "  - Logical inference and representation in FOL require careful handling of syntax and semantics.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Quantifiers**:\n",
    "   - $ \\forall s $: For all squares $ s $.\n",
    "   - $ \\exists r $: There exists a square $ r $.\n",

    "2. **Predicate Definitions**:\n",
    "   - $ \\text{Breezy}(s) $: True if square $ s $ is breezy.\n",

    "### Example in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we observe the following facts:\n",
    "1. $ \\text{Breezy}([2,2]) $: Square $[2,2]$ is breezy.\n",
    "2. $ \\text{Adjacent}([2,1], [2,2]) $, $ \\text{Adjacent}([2,3], [2,2]) $, etc.: Adjacency relations are predefined.\n",

    "---\n",

    "#### Code Illustration\n",
    "Here’s a Python representation of the logic using symbolic reasoning:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "from sympy.logic.boolalg import Or, And, Implies\n",
    "from sympy import symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define predicates\n",
    "Breezy, Adjacent, Pit = symbols('Breezy Adjacent Pit')\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "By using FOL:\n",
    "1. We concisely represent general rules like breeziness depending on adjacent pits.\n",
    "2. FOL avoids duplicating rules for every square, making the representation scalable.\n",
    "3. Inference allows the agent to deduce possible pit locations from observations.\n",
