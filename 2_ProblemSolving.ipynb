    "## **3.1 Problem-Solving Agents**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Problem-solving agents determine sequences of actions to achieve defined goals by exploring possible states and actions.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  1. **Goal Formulation**: Define the goal, narrowing the agent's focus to relevant actions.\n",
    "  2. **Problem Formulation**: Abstract the environment into a state space with states, actions, and transitions.\n",
    "  3. **Search**: Simulate action sequences to identify a solution path to the goal.\n",
    "  4. **Execution**: Carry out the actions in the solution to achieve the goal.\n",
    "- **Key Components**:\n",
    "  - **State Space**: All possible states the agent may encounter.\n",
    "  - **Initial State**: Starting point.\n",
    "  - **Goal State**: Target state or condition.\n",
    "  - **Transition Model**: How states change with actions.\n",
    "  - **Solution**: A sequence of actions leading to a goal state.\n",
    "  - **Optimal Solution**: Minimizes total cost or path cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Example Problems**\n",
    "- **Standardized Problems**:\n",
    "  - Serve as benchmarks for evaluating search algorithms.\n",
    "  - Include simplified models like grid-based navigation or puzzles.\n",
    "- **Real-World Problems**:\n",
    "  - Address practical needs, such as:\n",
    "    - **Route-Finding**: Optimize navigation between locations.\n",
    "    - **Travel Planning**: Manage complex constraints like layovers or costs.\n",
    "    - **Robot Navigation**: Pathfinding in multi-dimensional spaces with obstacles.\n",
    "    - **Assembly Sequencing**: Determine efficient steps for building objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.3 Search Algorithms**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Search algorithms explore the state space to find a solution path or determine failure.\n",
    "- **Key Concepts**:\n",
    "  - **State Space vs. Search Tree**:\n",
    "    - State Space: Represents all possible states and transitions.\n",
    "    - Search Tree: Tracks paths explored by the algorithm.\n",
    "  - **Performance Metrics**:\n",
    "    - **Completeness**: Ensures the algorithm finds a solution if one exists.\n",
    "    - **Cost Optimality**: Finds the lowest-cost solution.\n",
    "    - **Time Complexity**: Effort required to find a solution.\n",
    "    - **Space Complexity**: Memory needed during the search.\n",
    "  - **Avoiding Redundancy**:\n",
    "    - Eliminate repeated states and cycles to improve efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.4 Uninformed Search Strategies**\n",
    "- **Overview**: Uninformed (blind) search explores without prior knowledge about the goal's location.\n",
    "- **Methods**:\n",
    "  1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:\n",
    "     - Explores nodes level by level.\n",
    "     - Complete and cost-optimal for uniform costs but memory-intensive.\n",
    "  2. **Uniform-Cost Search**:\n",
    "     - Expands nodes based on cumulative path costs.\n",
    "     - Suitable for varying action costs; finds optimal solutions.\n",
    "  3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:\n",
    "     - Explores as deep as possible along one branch before backtracking.\n",
    "     - Memory-efficient but risks infinite loops or suboptimal solutions.\n",
    "  4. **Depth-Limited Search**:\n",
    "     - Adds a depth limit to DFS to prevent infinite exploration.\n",
    "  5. **Iterative Deepening Search**:\n",
    "     - Combines DFS and BFS by incrementally increasing the depth limit.\n",
    "     - Balances systematic exploration with memory efficiency.\n",
    "  6. **Bidirectional Search**:\n",
    "     - Searches forward from the start and backward from the goal, reducing effective search depth."

    "- $ D(Q, NSW, V, T) = \\{\\text{Red, Green, Blue}\\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Select Next Variable\n",
    "Using MRV, we choose $ NT $, as it now has the smallest domain ($ 2 $ values).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Assign a Value\n",
